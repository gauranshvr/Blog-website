            <h2>Pablo Ruiz Picasso</h2>
            <p>art & design is my passion</p>
          </div>
          <p> Pablo Ruiz Picasso (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish
            painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France.
            Regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist
            movement, the invention of constructed sculpture,[8][9] the co-invention of collage, and for the wide
            variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les
            Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German
            and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.</p>
          <p>Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner
            through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he
            experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the slightly
            older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry
            between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern
            art.</p>

            <p>>Picasso's work is often categorized into periods. While the names of many of his later periods are debated,
            the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901–1904), the Rose Period (1904–1906),
            the African-influenced Period (1907–1909), Analytic Cubism (1909–1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919),
            also referred to as the Crystal period. Much of Picasso's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a
            neoclassical style, and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism. His later work
            often combines elements of his earlier styles.</p>
